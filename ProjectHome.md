The Picasa photo manager is an amazing application. It is probably one of the best I have used. Unfortunately, it is a bit over the top for solely managing webalbums. On top of that, the Linux version does not yet support Webalbum uploading.

The folks at the Mono project have developed a nice set of classes that provides data access to Picasa webalbums; it's called google-sharp. Unfortunately the only application that uses it is F-Spot, which is possibly one of the worst pieces of software I have ever used.

So the plan is to write a simple photo manager for Picasa.
